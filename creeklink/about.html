				<p>The Creek link web site is operated by the not for profit organization registered 
				as CREEK-LINK AUS INC. The origins of Creek link is an idea that began and was nurtured 
				in the East Otway Landcare Group. The East Otway Landcare Group is located in the Otway 
				Ranges in South Western Victoria.</p>

    				<pCreek link is a simple online mapping tool which enables local community groups 
    				to record key information about their local waterways.</p>
					<p>Creek link uses a colour coded graphic to visually represent;</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Where native vegetation exists along waterways</li>
					<li>Where stock have been excluded from waterways and</li>
					<li>Where landholders have expressed an interest in undertaking future revegetation works</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Users can also obtain additional information about individual sections of a 
					waterway by highlighting their particular area of interest. Once a specific area 
					of interest, or segment, is highlighted an associated “Details box” will appear to 
					the right of the map containing additional information such as the name of the creek, 
					the date of revegetation works etc.</p>

				<p>We hope that the Creek link web site will enable;
				<ul>
				<li>Community groups to maximize the effectiveness of future revegetation projects. 
				Groups like Landcare will be able to focus their efforts on linking and extending 
				existing areas of native vegetation, rather than carrying out projects in isolation.</li>
				<li>The broader Community will have the opportunity to share the excitement and sense 
				of achievement that comes from seeing how many waterway rehabilitation projects have 
				already been undertaken in a given area.</li>
				<li>For the first time funding bodies will be able to see online where future projects 
				are being proposed, and additionally to monitor the successful completion of those 
				projects as well.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The online map has been designed as a template which has the potential to be easily 
				used by community groups anywhere in Australia. The Web site uses open source and 
				interoperable software helping minimize costs and permitting the easy exchange of data 
				between communities and government agencies.</p>
